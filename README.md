# This Project uses:

-vite, fast pre-configured build tool

-js (Just started learning typescript better not add too much complexity)

-vue3, why vue: first off you seamed slightly partial to vue during our first meeting, and after a quick comparaison to React, vue looked very promising. With TypeScript support in vue3 and Ionic vue for crossplatform apps(alternative to React Native) it should be a solid alternative at the very least. I am however a complete novice at vue and it does show..

-vuex 4, for State management

# To run execute following commands(from folder):

npm install(To initialize node_modules)

npm run dev

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.
